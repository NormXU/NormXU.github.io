Hello! There! 👋🏻

This is Norm Inui. I'm currently working on developing a VideoGen Model at a startup, MoonShot AI. My deep learning interests cover various domains, including:

- ~~Very-Rich Document Understanding~~
- ~~Optical Character Recognition~~
- ~~Object Detection~~
- Large Language Models
- Video Generation

I can speak English, Japanese, and Chinese. My preferred holiday destination is Kyoto, Japan. 

This website is a platform to catalog and share my inspirations. Hope my posts can be helpful to you.
