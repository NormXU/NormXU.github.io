Hello! There! 👋🏻

This is Norm Inui. I'm currently working on developing a multimodal model at a startup. My deep learning interests cover various domains, including:

- Very-Rich Document Understanding
- Optical Character Recognition
- Object Detection
- Large Language Models
- Stable Diffusion

I can speak English, Japanese, and Chinese. My preferred holiday destination is Kyoto, Japan. 

This website is a platform to catalog and share my inspirations. Hope my posts can be helpful to you.
