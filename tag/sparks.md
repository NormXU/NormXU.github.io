This page is a repository for collecting my inspirational sparks, which Iâ€™m unable to experiment due to limited access to data and computational resources. I hope that my ideas can still inspire you.

<ul class="post-list">
  {%- for post in site.tags["Sparks"] -%}
    <li>
      {%- assign date_format = site.minima.date_format | default: "%Y-%m-%d" -%}
      <span class="post-meta">
        {{ post.date | date: date_format }}
      </span>
      <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | relative_url }}">
          {{ post.title | escape }}
      </a>
    </li>
  {%- endfor -%}
</ul>
